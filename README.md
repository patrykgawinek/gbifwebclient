# What is the GBIF Client web app?

The GBIF Client web app is a front-end web app that gives you a more user friendly experience when accessing GBIF's dataset. GBIF is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth. This means that you can find data on a plethora of species and recorded occurrences of said species.

# What was this project made for?

This project was initially a school project that I expanded on a bit since I caught more interest in it than I actually thought. It would be useful for both ecologists and anyone that likes to find rare species in their area.

# Is the web app hosted?

Yes it is! You can find it here: [https://gbif-client.web.app/](https://gbif-client.web.app/)
